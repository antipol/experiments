        As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of
        realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . .
        . and this is exploration at its greatest. Never in all their history
        have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single
        sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which
        all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because
        every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as
        equals. The airman’s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a
        globe in practice, not in theory. To be the first to enter the cosmos,
        to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one
        dream of anything more?

        We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
        because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
        serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
        because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
        unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win. There can be no
        thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and
        literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how
        much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.
